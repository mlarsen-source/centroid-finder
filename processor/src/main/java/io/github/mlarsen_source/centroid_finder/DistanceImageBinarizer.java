 * An implementation of the ImageBinarizer interface that uses color distance
 * to determine whether each pixel should be black or white in the binary image.

 * The binarization is based on the Euclidean distance between a pixel's color and a reference target color.
 * If the distance is less than the threshold, the pixel is considered white (1);
 * otherwise, it is considered black (0).
 * 
 * The color distance is computed using a provided ColorDistanceFinder, which defines how to compare two colors numerically.
 * The targetColor is represented as a 24-bit RGB integer in the form 0xRRGGBB.
